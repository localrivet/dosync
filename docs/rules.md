# Rules & Conventions

This document summarizes the key coding standards and conventions for DOSync.

## Development Workflow

- Follow the [dev_workflow](../.cursor/rules/dev_workflow.mdc) for task-driven development using Task Master.
- Log implementation plans and progress in Task Master subtasks.
- Mark tasks as done when complete.

## Rule Improvement

- Follow [self_improve](../.cursor/rules/self_improve.mdc) for guidelines on updating and improving rules.
- Add new rules when new patterns emerge or common bugs are found.
- Update rules with better examples or when implementation details change.

## Taskmaster Usage

- See [taskmaster](../.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc) for a comprehensive reference on Task Master tools and commands.

## How to Update Rules

- Review code changes and chat history after completing a subtask.
- Identify new or modified patterns, conventions, or best practices.
- Add or update rules in the appropriate `.mdc` file.
- Cross-reference related rules and keep documentation up to date.

See [Contributing](contributing.md) for more on our workflow.
